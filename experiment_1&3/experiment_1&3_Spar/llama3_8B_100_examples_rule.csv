8. relation(near, medium_black_circle, medium_blue_square). relation(left, medium_blue_square, large_black_square).

Now, let's analyze the query: ""Is the medium blue thing below a medium black thing?""

We can identify the key information in the facts that directly relate to the query:

* The medium blue thing is a small blue triangle (object(small_blue_triangle, small, blue, triangle, b)).
* The medium black thing is a medium black circle (object(medium_black_circle, medium, black, circle, c)).
* The medium black circle is near and to the left of a medium blue square (relation(near, medium_black_circle, medium_blue_square)).

From the facts, we can conclude that the medium blue thing (small blue triangle) is not below the medium black thing (medium black circle). The small blue triangle is far to the right of the large black triangle, which is near and above the medium yellow triangle. The medium black circle is near and to the left of the medium blue square, which is near and to the left of the large black square.

Therefore, the answer is: No.",Yes

**Step 2: Analyze the given facts, highlight and explain the key information in the facts of the context that directly relate to the query**

Key information:

* Block A has four medium squares: two yellow and two blue.
* One blue square (blue_square1) is touching the bottom edge of block A.
* The other blue square (blue_square2) is on top of blue_square1.
* The yellow squares are on top of blue_square2.
* Block A is on top of block B.
* Block B has two black squares stacked on top of each other.

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks if there is any square below all other squares. We can analyze the facts to find the answer.

**Step 4: Answer the question**

From the facts, we can conclude that blue_square1 is the square below all other squares. It is touching the bottom edge of block A, which means it is the lowest square in block A. Since block A is on top of block B, blue_square1 is also the lowest square in the entire structure.

**Answer:** Yes, there is a square (blue_square1) below all other squares.

**Justification:** The logical rule used is the ""Object-block relationship"" rule, which states that if an object is in a block, and the block has a relation with another block, then the object has the same relation with the other block. In this case, blue_square1 is in block A, and block A is on top of block B, so blue_square1 is below all other squares.",Yes

The key information that directly relates to the query is:

* The large yellow circle is near the small blue circle (fact 16).
* The small black circle is near the small blue circle (fact 17).

**Step 3: Draw Connections between Query and Facts**

The query asks what object is near the large yellow thing. The large yellow thing is the large yellow circle. From the facts, we know that the large yellow circle is near the small blue circle (fact 16). Therefore, the answer is:

* The small blue circle is near the large yellow thing.

The small yellow triangle is not near the large yellow thing, as it is touching the top of the large blue triangle in block B, which is not near the large yellow circle.

The answer is not both of them, as the query asks for a single object that is near the large yellow thing. The answer is not none of them, as the small blue circle is indeed near the large yellow thing.

Now, let's analyze the query: ""Is the big square above all black objects?""

From the facts, we can identify the following key information:

* The big blue square is in block A (fact 3).
* The small black triangle is in block B (fact 9).
* The big blue circle is above the small black triangle (fact 18).

We can draw connections between the query and facts:

* The query asks if the big square is above all black objects.
* The only black object mentioned is the small black triangle.
* The big blue circle is above the small black triangle, but the big blue square is not mentioned in relation to the small black triangle.

Using the logical rules, we can conclude that:

* The big blue square is not above the small black triangle (fact 18 does not mention the big blue square).
* The big blue square is not above any other black objects (there are no other black objects mentioned).

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

No, the big square is not above all black objects.

Justification: The big blue square is not mentioned in relation to the small black triangle, and there are no other black objects mentioned.",Yes

* The little white circle is touching the top edge of block C.
* The midsize red circle is touching the left edge of block C.

From these facts, we can conclude that the little white circle is above the huge red rectangle.

Answer: Yes

Now, let's analyze the query: ""What is to the right of a big blue triangle?""

From the facts, we know that block B is to the right of block A and C, and block B has a big black circle to the left of a medium black triangle. This means that the big blue triangle (which is in block A) is not to the right of anything in block B.

However, we also know that block B has a medium yellow square above and to the left of a medium black triangle. This means that the big blue triangle (which is in block A) is not to the right of the medium yellow square (which is in block B).

Therefore, the answer is: none of them.

Justification:

* We cannot conclude that a blue square is to the right of the big blue triangle because there is no fact that suggests a blue square is in block B or to the right of the big blue triangle.
* We cannot conclude that a blue triangle is to the right of the big blue triangle because there is no fact that suggests a blue triangle is in block B or to the right of the big blue triangle.
* We cannot conclude that both of them are to the right of the big blue triangle because there is no fact that suggests both a blue square and a blue triangle are in block B or to the right of the big blue triangle.

Now, I will analyze the given facts and highlight the key information that directly relates to the query.

The query is ""Does A have any circles inside of it?"" To answer this, we need to check if there are any objects of type ""circle"" located inside block ""A"".

From the facts, we can see that there are two objects of type ""circle"" located in block ""A"": medium_blue_circle and small_black_circle. However, the facts do not provide any information about the location of these objects within block ""A"".

To answer the query, we need to apply the spatial logical rules. Since the query is asking about the presence of circles inside block ""A"", we can apply the ""Object-block relationship"" rule. This rule states that if an object is in a block, and the block has a relation with the object, then the object has the same relation with the block.

From the facts, we can see that the small_black_circle is near to the left of a large blue circle, and the large blue circle is in block ""B"", not block ""A"". Therefore, the small_black_circle is not in block ""A"".

However, the medium_blue_circle is not mentioned to have any relation with block ""A"" or any other block. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the medium_blue_circle is in block ""A"" or not.

Since we cannot conclude whether the medium_blue_circle is in block ""A"" or not, we cannot answer the query with certainty. Therefore, the answer is ""DK"" (Don't Know).",No

* Block A does not have any black objects inside (only a small blue square).
* Block B has a small black triangle and a black square.
* Block C has a small yellow square, a blue triangle, a small blue circle, and a black circle.

Now, let's analyze the facts and highlight the key information that directly relates to the query:

* The query asks which block has a square to the right of another square.
* From fact 21, we know that the small square is to the left of another small square.
* From fact 24, we know that block B is above block A.
* From fact 25, we know that block C is above block B.

Now, let's draw connections between the query and facts:

* Since the small squares are in block C (fact 17), and block C is above block B (fact 24), it's possible that the small squares are in block B.
* However, we need to check if there are any squares in block B that are to the right of another square.
* From fact 7, we know that there is a medium black square at the top of block B.
* From fact 8, we know that there is a big blue square at the top of block B and near the medium square.
* Since the big blue square is near the medium square, it's possible that the big blue square is to the right of the medium square.

Now, let's apply the spatial logical rules:

* From fact 8, we know that the big blue square is near the medium square.
* Since the big blue square is near the medium square, it's possible that the big blue square is to the right of the medium square.
* Therefore, block B has a square to the right of another square.

* The white square is in block B (fact 19)
* The blue triangle is above the orange rectangle (fact 12)
* The yellow square is above the white square (fact 22)

**Step 3: Draw Connections between Query and Facts**

The query asks if the orange thing (rectangle) is to the right of the white thing (square). We can draw connections between the query and facts as follows:

* The orange rectangle is in block A (fact 14)
* The white square is in block B (fact 19)
* Block A is to the right of block B (fact 11)

**Step 4: Answer the Question**

Using the connections drawn, we can conclude that the orange rectangle is not to the right of the white square. The orange rectangle is in block A, which is to the right of block B, where the white square is located. Therefore, the answer is:

**No**

Justification: The logical rule used is the ""block relation"" rule, which states that if block A is to the right of block B, then any object in block A is to the right of any object in block B. In this case, the orange rectangle is in block A, and the white square is in block B, so the orange rectangle is not to the right of the white square.",No

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is not near the small black thing, the medium yellow square or the large blue circle?""

To answer this, we need to identify the objects that are not near these three objects. Let's examine the facts:

* The small black thing is the small black triangle (fact 6).
* The medium yellow square is mentioned in fact 14, but its location is not specified.
* The large blue circle is mentioned in facts 6, 9, and 11.

From the facts, we can conclude that the small black triangle is near the large blue circle (fact 7). The medium yellow square's location is unknown, so we can't determine if it's near the small black thing or the large blue circle.

The objects that are near the small black thing are:

* The large blue circle (fact 7)
* The small blue circle (fact 10)

The objects that are near the medium yellow square are:

* The small yellow circle (fact 15)
* The medium black triangle (fact 16)
* The blue triangle (fact 22)
* The large yellow square (fact 25)

The objects that are near the large blue circle are:

* The small black triangle (fact 7)
* The small blue circle (fact 10)

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the object that is not near the small black thing, the medium yellow square, or the large blue circle is:

* The medium yellow square (since its location is unknown, we can't determine if it's near any of these objects)

So, the correct answer is:

* The medium yellow square",the medium yellow square

A yellow square is touching the top edge of A and below that there is a red oval is touching the right edge of A. There is a second block call B Which is to the left of A. Inside B there are 3 squares, a brown one, a green one, and a red one. The green square is above the red square and touching the left edge of B. The brown square is touching both the bottom edge and the right edge of B. The red square is touching the left edge of the brown square.",Are all of the squares in B?,YN,"Yes, No, DK",No,['Quantifier'],"Let's break down the context into facts:

16. touching(right_edge_b, brown_square).
17. touching(left_edge_brown_square, red_square).

Now, let's analyze the query: ""Are all of the squares in B?""

From the facts, we can identify the following key information:

* There are three squares in block B: brown, green, and red.
* The green square is above the red square.
* The brown square is touching both the bottom edge and the right edge of B.
* The red square is touching the left edge of the brown square.

Using the logical rules, we can draw connections between the query and facts:

* The query asks if all squares are in block B. We can use the ""object-block relationship"" rule to conclude that each square (brown, green, and red) is in block B, since they are all objects with the same block location (b).
* The query also asks if all squares are in block B. We can use the ""inter-block object relationship"" rule to conclude that the squares are not only in block B but also have a specific spatial relationship with each other (above, touching edges).

Based on the analysis, we can answer the query directly:

Answer: Yes, all of the squares are in B.

Justification: The facts provide evidence that each square (brown, green, and red) is in block B, and they have specific spatial relationships with each other within block B.",Yes

Now, let's analyze the query: ""Is the small blue thing near and to the right of the medium yellow thing?""

The query is asking about the relationship between the small blue thing and the medium yellow thing. From the facts, we can identify the small blue thing as the small blue triangle (object(small_blue_triangle, small, blue, triangle, B)) and the medium yellow thing as the medium yellow triangle (object(medium_yellow_triangle, medium, yellow, triangle, B)).

From the facts, we can see that the small blue triangle is above the medium blue triangle (above(small_blue_triangle, medium_blue_triangle, B)), and the medium blue triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle (right(medium_blue_triangle, medium_yellow_triangle, B)). This means that the small blue triangle is above and to the right of the medium yellow triangle.

However, the query is asking about the relationship between the small blue thing and the medium yellow thing in terms of being near and to the right. From the facts, we can see that the small blue triangle is near the medium yellow triangle (near(medium_yellow_triangle, small_blue_triangle, B)) and to the left of it (left(medium_yellow_triangle, small_blue_triangle, B)). This means that the small blue triangle is not near and to the right of the medium yellow triangle.

Therefore, the answer to the query is: No.",No

* The query is asking if B is near C.
* From fact 18, we know that B is far to the left of C.
* However, the query is asking if B is near C, not far from C.

To answer the query, we need to apply the spatial logical rules. Since ""near"" is a symmetric relation, we can conclude that C is also near B.

Answer: Yes, B is near C.

Justification: The query is asking if B is near C, and since ""near"" is a symmetric relation, we can conclude that C is also near B, making the answer Yes.",Yes

Now, let's analyze the query: ""Is the thing that touches the bottom of B to the left of a small yellow thing?""

The query is asking about the relationship between the thing that touches the bottom of B and a small yellow thing. From the facts, we know that the bottom medium square touches the bottom of B (fact 16). We also know that the small yellow square is near and to the left of the bottom medium square (fact 17).

Using the fact that the small yellow square is near and to the left of the bottom medium square, we can conclude that the small yellow square is to the left of the thing that touches the bottom of B (the bottom medium square).

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Query: Which block contains all black objects?

To answer this query, we need to find the block that contains all the black objects. From the facts, we can see that there are two black objects: a small black triangle and a large black square. Both of these objects are located in block B.

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" logical rule, we can conclude that:

* The small black triangle is in block B.
* The large black square is in block B.

Since both black objects are in block B, we can answer the query as follows:

Answer: B

Justification: The query asks which block contains all black objects. From the facts, we know that both black objects (small black triangle and large black square) are located in block B. Therefore, block B is the correct answer.",B

The key information that directly relates to the query is the presence of yellow objects in each block. Specifically, we can identify the following yellow objects:

* In block A: none
* In block B: medium yellow circle, large yellow triangle, small yellow square
* In block C: none

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks which block does not have a yellow thing inside of it. Based on the facts, we can conclude that:

* Block A does not have a yellow object.
* Block B has multiple yellow objects.
* Block C does not have a yellow object.

**Step 4: Answer the question**

The answer to the question is **A**. Block A does not have a yellow object inside of it.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""Is the large black thing far to the right of the small blue thing?""

We need to identify the large black thing and the small blue thing. From the facts, we can conclude that:

* The large black thing is the large black circle (object(large_black_circle, large, black, circle, B)).
* The small blue thing is the small blue square (object(small_blue_square, small, blue, square, B)).

The query asks if the large black thing is far to the right of the small blue thing. However, the context only provides information about the left and right relationships between blocks, not between objects within the blocks.

We can apply the spatial logical rules to help us answer the query:

* Since there is no direct information about the right relationship between the large black circle and the small blue square, we cannot conclude that the large black thing is far to the right of the small blue thing.
* We can apply the inverse relation rule to the fact ""far_left(small_blue_square, large_black_circle)"" to get ""large_black_circle is far_right_of small_blue_square"". However, this does not provide the information we need to answer the query.

Since we cannot conclude that the large black thing is far to the right of the small blue thing based on the given facts, our answer is:

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is not near the medium yellow thing in C?""

The medium yellow thing in C refers to the small yellow square. We need to find out which object is not near the small yellow square.

From fact 11, we know that the small blue square is far above the small yellow square. This means it is not near the small yellow square.

From fact 6, we know that the large black triangle is near the large black square in block A. Since block A is not C, the large black triangle is not near the small yellow square in C.

From fact 8, we know that the large blue triangle is to the right of the large black triangle in block A. Since block A is not C, the large blue triangle is not near the small yellow square in C.

Therefore, the answer is:

* the large black triangle
* the large blue triangle

8. object(small_black_triangle, unknown, black, triangle, C) // small black triangle is in C, to the right of small blue circle

Now, let's analyze the facts and highlight the key information that directly relates to the query:

* The query asks which block has all small objects.
* From the facts, we can see that block C has two small objects: small blue circle and small black triangle.

Using the logical rules, we can draw connections between the query and facts:

* Inter-block object relationship: If an object is in a block, and another object is in the same block, then the objects are related.
* Object-block relationship: If an object is in a block, then the block is related to the object.

From the facts, we can conclude that block C has all small objects (small blue circle and small black triangle). Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Answer: C

Justification: The query asks which block has all small objects. From the facts, we can see that block C has two small objects, which satisfies the query.

""What object is to the right of the medium black thing, the small yellow circle or the large black square?""

The medium black thing refers to the medium black circle. We need to find out which object is to the right of the medium black circle.

From fact 11, we know that the small yellow circle is near and to the left of the medium black circle. This means the small yellow circle is not to the right of the medium black circle.

From fact 13, we know that the medium blue square is near and to the left of the large black square. This means the large black square is not to the right of the medium black circle either.

However, we can use the transitive relation ""left"" to find the object to the right of the medium black circle. Since A is to the left of B, and B is to the left of C, we can conclude that C is to the right of B.

From fact 12, we know that the large black square is in block C. Therefore, the large black square is to the right of the medium black circle.

From the facts, we can identify the following key information:

* The blue circle is touching the top edge of block B (fact 6).
* The small square is in block C (fact 8).
* Block C is to the left of block A (fact 13).
* Block A is to the right of block B (fact 12).

Applying the spatial logical rules, we can answer the query:

The relation between the blue circle which is touching the top edge of block B and the small square is **left**.

We can draw connections between the query and facts:

* The query is asking about the relation between the yellow circle and the big circle in block C.
* The medium yellow circle is in block C, and the big black circle is also in block C.
* The big black circle is touching the bottom edge of block C, which means it is below the medium yellow circle (since the medium yellow circle is touching the top edge).

The large black thing refers to the large black square. To find the object to the right of it, we need to look for an object that is related to the large black square through the ""right"" relation.

From the facts, we can see that the medium black square is to the right of the small yellow square, which is near the large black square. Therefore, the medium black square is to the right of the large black square.

The medium blue square is not related to the large black square through the ""right"" relation.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What is the relation between the red square above a green object and a red triangle to the left of a green object?""

We can identify the key information in the facts that directly relate to the query:

* The red square above a green object is the big red square (object(big_red_square, ..., a)) which is above the small green circle (object(small_green_circle, ..., a)).
* The red triangle to the left of a green object is the medium red triangle (object(medium_red_triangle, ..., b)) which is to the left of the small green square (object(small_green_square, ..., b)).

From the facts, we can conclude that the big red square is above the small green circle, and the medium red triangle is to the left of the small green square. However, we need to find the relation between the big red square and the medium red triangle.

Using the ""Inter-block object relationship"" logical rule, we can infer that the big red square is above the medium red square (fact 6), and the medium red square is above the small green square (fact 7). Therefore, we can conclude that the big red square is above the small green square.

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" logical rule, we can infer that the medium red triangle is in block B (fact 3), and the small green square is in block B (fact 3). Therefore, we can conclude that the medium red triangle is in block B.

Now, we can apply the ""Inverse relation"" logical rule to find the relation between the big red square and the medium red triangle. Since the big red square is above the small green square, and the medium red triangle is to the left of the small green square, we can conclude that the medium red triangle is below the big red square.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

* Block B has a big blue square above the medium yellow circle number one.
* The medium black triangle in Block A is to the right of the medium yellow circle number two.
* The medium black triangle in Block B is to the right of the medium yellow circle number one.

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks which block has a triangle below another triangle. We can see that:

* In Block A, the medium black triangle is touching the bottom edge of the block, which means it is below the other objects in the block.
* In Block B, the medium black triangle is not explicitly stated to be below another triangle.

**Step 4: Answer the question**

Based on the facts, we can conclude that:

* Block A has a triangle (medium black triangle) below another triangle (medium yellow triangle).
* Block B does not have a triangle below another triangle.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

**A**

Justification: The logical rule used is the ""Object-block relationship"" rule, which states that if an object is in a block, and the block has a relation with another object, then the object has the same relation with the other object.

* The green square is on top of the purple square (fact 16).
* The yellow square is above the white square (fact 12).
* The white square is to the left of the green square (fact 11).

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks if the green thing is to the right of a yellow object. From the facts, we know that the green square is on top of the purple square, and the yellow square is above the white square. However, we don't have any direct information about the position of the green square relative to the yellow square.

**Step 4: Apply relevant spatial logical rules to answer the question**

We can apply the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule to connect the objects across blocks. Since the green square is on top of the purple square, and the purple square is touching the bottom of B, we can conclude that the green square is also in block B.

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" logical rule, we can infer that the brown oval is in block C.

Now, let's draw connections between the query and facts:

* If A is above C, then the brown oval (which is in block C) should be below the pink triangle (which is at the bottom of A).
* However, we don't have any information that suggests the brown oval is below the pink triangle.

Since we can't conclude that A is above C based on the given facts, we need to apply spatial logical rules to answer the question.

* Block A has a red triangle, a black circle, a yellow square, and a red oval.
* Block B has a brown square, a green square, and a red square.
* The green square is above the red square in Block B.
* The brown square is touching both the bottom edge and the right edge of Block B.
* The red square is touching the left edge of the brown square in Block B.

The query asks which block has only squares inside. To answer this, we need to check the objects inside each block.

For Block A, we have a red triangle, a black circle, a yellow square, and a red oval. None of these objects are squares.

For Block B, we have a brown square, a green square, and a red square. All three objects are squares.

Based on the facts, we can conclude that Block B has only squares inside. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer: B

Justification: The query asks which block has only squares inside. By analyzing the facts, we found that Block A has non-square objects, while Block B has only squares. Therefore, Block B is the correct answer.",B

The key information that directly relates to the query is the position of the big yellow triangles in block B. Specifically, one of the triangles is touching the bottom edge of block B.

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks about the relation between the big yellow triangle that is touching the bottom edge of block B and another big yellow triangle. We can draw a connection between the query and fact 16, which states that one of the big yellow triangles is touching the bottom edge of block B.

**Step 4: If the query can be solved by the given facts, answer the question directly**

Based on the facts, we can conclude that the big yellow triangle that is touching the bottom edge of block B is adjacent to another big yellow triangle (since they are both part of the same block B).

**Answer:** The relation between the big yellow triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block and another big yellow triangle is **touching**.

Justification: The logical rule used here is the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule, which states that if Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2. In this case, both big yellow triangles are in block B, and they are adjacent to each other, making their relation **touching**.",touching

Key information in the facts that directly relate to the query:

* The big blue square is above the medium yellow circle number one in block B (fact 5).
* The medium yellow circle number two is in block B (fact 3).

Connection between the query and facts:

* The query asks about the relation between the square and the circle number two in block B.
* The facts provide information about the position of the square (above the medium yellow circle number one) and the presence of the circle number two in block B.

Answer:

The relation between the square and the circle number two in block B is ""below"". This can be inferred using the logical rule ""Inter-block object relationship"": If Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block1, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2.

What is the relation between all black squares and the blue square?

We can represent this query as:

?R(black_square, blue_square)

To answer this query, we need to analyze the facts and find the connection between the black squares and the blue square.

From fact 9, we know that the first black square is on top of the yellow square in block C. From fact 7, we know that the yellow square is on top of the blue square in block A. Therefore, we can conclude that the first black square is above the blue square.

From fact 10, we know that the second black square is on top of the first black square in block C. This doesn't provide any direct connection to the blue square.

From fact 11, we know that the third black square is touching the bottom edge of block C. This doesn't provide any direct connection to the blue square.

Since we have found a connection between the first black square and the blue square (above), we can answer the query as:

**Step 2: Highlight and Explain Key Information**

Key information:

* The red triangle is in block A.
* The small green square is in block B.
* The red square above another red square is the big red square.
* The small green square is below the medium red square.

**Step 3: Draw Connections between Query and Facts**

The query asks about the location of the red triangle regarding to the red square above another red square. From the facts, we know that the red triangle is in block A, and the red square above another red square is the big red square, which is in block A. Therefore, the red triangle is in the same block as the red square above another red square.

**Step 4: Apply Spatial Logical Rules**

Using the rule ""Inter-block object relationship"", if the red triangle is in block A and the big red square is in block A, then the red triangle is related to the big red square.

**Step 5: Answer the Question**

The red triangle which is to the right of a small square regarding to the red square above another red square is **right** of the big red square.

Justification:

* The red triangle is in block A, and the big red square is in block A.
* The red triangle is to the right of the small green square, which is in block B.
* The big red square is above the medium red square, which is in block A.

7. object(medium_blue_circle, medium, blue, circle, C)

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is not below the large blue thing?""

The large blue thing refers to the large blue triangle. We need to find out which objects are below it.

From fact 5, we know that the small blue circle is near and above the large blue triangle. From fact 6, we know that the large black circle is far below the small blue circle. Therefore, the large black circle is below the small blue circle, which is above the large blue triangle.

From fact 4, we know that the medium black circle is above the large blue triangle. Therefore, the medium black circle is not below the large blue triangle.

Conclusion:

The object that is not below the large blue thing is the medium black circle.

Justification:

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" logical rule, we can infer that the medium black circle is above the large blue triangle. This is because the medium black circle is in block B, and block B is to the right of block C, which contains the large blue triangle. Therefore, the medium black circle is not below the large blue triangle.

Key information:

* The black thing is the black square (object(black_square, unknown, black, square, c)).
* The small blue thing is one of the small blue circles (object(small_blue_circle, small, blue, circle, a)).

To answer the query, we need to find the relation between the black square and the small blue circles. Since the black square is in block C, and the small blue circles are in block A, we can't directly relate them. However, we can use the spatial logical rules to help us.

Applying the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule, we can infer that if an object is in block A and another object is in block C, and block A is to the left of block C, then the object in block A is to the left of the object in block C.

Since block A is to the left of block B, and block B is to the left of block C, we can conclude that block A is to the left of block C. Therefore, the small blue circles in block A are to the left of the black square in block C.

However, the query asks about the relation between the black thing and the small blue thing, not the blocks. To answer this, we need to consider the spatial relationships within each block.

Since the small blue circles are below the large blue circle in block A, and the black square is below the yellow triangle in block C, we can't directly relate the small blue circles and the black square.

The only remaining options are ""near to"" and ""far from"". Since we don't have any information about the distance between the small blue circles and the black square, we can't determine the exact relation. Therefore, the answer is ""DK"" (Don't Know).",Below

Key information:

* block(A) and block(B) exist.
* A has a big blue square, two medium blue squares, and a big blue triangle.
* B has a big blue triangle, a small black triangle, a big blue circle, and a medium blue triangle.
* The medium blue squares are below the big blue square in block A.
* The medium blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of block B.

**Step 4: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks which block has a medium object below a big object. From the facts, we can see that:

* In block A, the medium blue squares are below the big blue square.
* In block B, the medium blue triangle is below the big blue triangle.

**Step 5: Answer the question**

Answer: Both block A and block B have a medium object below a big object.

""What is the relation between the circle above the blue triangle and the black object below a blue triangle?""

The key information in the facts that directly relate to the query is:

* The circle is above the blue triangle (relation(above, big_blue_circle, medium_blue_triangle)).
* The black object is below a blue triangle (relation(below, small_black_triangle, big_blue_triangle)).

Using the ""Inter-block object relationship"" logical rule, we can infer that the circle is above the black object:

* If Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2.
* The circle is in block B, the black object is in block B, and block A [Relation] block B (relation(below, a, b)). Therefore, the circle is above the black object.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is to the left of the small black square, the small black triangle or the large black triangle, the small black triangle or the large black triangle?""

We can rephrase the query as:

""What object is to the left of the small black square, the small black triangle, or the large black triangle?""

From the facts, we know that the small black square is in block B, and the small black triangle is also in block B. The large black triangle is in block C.

We can apply the ""left_of"" relation to find the object to the left of the small black triangle:

* The small black triangle is in block B, and the medium yellow circle is in block C, which is to the left of block B. Therefore, the medium yellow circle is to the left of the small black triangle.

However, the query asks about the object to the left of the small black square, the small black triangle, or the large black triangle. Since the small black square and the small black triangle are in the same block (B), we can apply the ""left_of"" relation again:

* The small black square is to the right of the small black triangle in block B. Therefore, there is no object to the left of the small black square and the small black triangle.

For the large black triangle, we can apply the ""left_of"" relation again:

* The large black triangle is in block C, and the small blue circle is in block A, which is to the left of block C. Therefore, the small blue circle is to the left of the large black triangle.

In summary, the object to the left of the small black square, the small black triangle, or the large black triangle is:

* The medium yellow circle (to the left of the small black triangle)
* The small blue circle (to the left of the large black triangle)

So, the correct answer is:

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is far from the yellow thing?""

The ""yellow thing"" refers to the large yellow circle. We need to find out which object is far from the large yellow circle.

From fact 5, we know that the large yellow circle is touching the bottom of block B. This means that the large yellow circle is in block B.

From fact 4, we know that the large blue triangle is in block B, near the large blue square.

From fact 6, we know that the small black triangle is in block C, to the right of the small blue circle.

Using the ""Inter-block object relationship"" logical rule, we can conclude that the large blue triangle is near the large yellow circle (since they are in the same block).

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" logical rule, we can conclude that the large blue triangle is in block B.

Using the ""Inverse relation"" logical rule, we can conclude that the large yellow circle is below the large blue triangle (since below is the inverse of above).

From these conclusions, we can answer the query:

The large blue triangle is far from the yellow thing.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is far from the small black thing?""

The small black thing refers to the small black triangles in block B. We need to find an object that is far from these small black triangles.

From the facts, we can see that the small black triangles are in block B, and the small blue circles are also in block B, far above the small black triangles. Therefore, the small blue circles are not far from the small black triangles.

The large yellow circle is in block A, which is to the left of block B. This means that the large yellow circle is not far from the small black triangles in block B.

The large blue triangle in block C is near and to the left of the medium black circle, and the large black triangle is near and below the large blue triangle. However, these objects are not directly related to the small black triangles in block B.

Based on the facts, we can conclude that:

* The small blue circle is not far from the small black thing.
* The large yellow circle is not far from the small black thing.
* There is no object that is far from the small black thing.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Step 2: Analyze the given facts, highlight and explain the key information in the facts of the context that directly relate to the query**

The key information that directly relates to the query is the location of the triangles in each block. Specifically, we know that:

* In block A, there is a medium blue triangle.
* In block B, there is no triangle mentioned.
* In block C, there is a small blue triangle and a medium black triangle.

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks which block has all of the triangles inside of it. We can draw connections between the query and the facts as follows:

* Block A has a medium blue triangle.
* Block C has a small blue triangle and a medium black triangle.

**Step 4: Answer the question**

Based on the facts, we can conclude that block C has all of the triangles inside of it. This is because block C has both a small blue triangle and a medium black triangle, whereas block A only has a medium blue triangle.

**Answer:** C

**Justification:** The answer is justified by the fact that block C has all of the triangles inside of it, as mentioned in the query. The logical rule used is the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule, which states that if Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2. In this case, the triangles are the objects, and the blocks are the locations.",B

8. object(small_blue_circle, small, blue, circle, B) // small blue circle is in block B
9. object(medium_blue_triangle, medium, blue, triangle, C) // medium blue triangle is in block C

Now, let's convert the question into a query:

What block does not have any blue objects inside of it?

Query: Which block does not contain any blue object?

To answer this query, we need to analyze the facts and identify the blocks that do not contain any blue objects.

From the facts, we can see that block A does not contain any blue objects. The only blue object mentioned is the small blue circle in block B.

Using the logical rule ""Object-block relationship"", we can conclude that the small blue circle is in block B.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Answer: B",A

* The small yellow squares are in block A.
* The medium yellow circle is below the small yellow square in block A.
* The small black triangle is to the left of the large black square in block B.
* The small blue circle is far below the large black square in block B.

**Step 3: Draw Connections between Query and Facts**

The query asks if the medium blue thing is to the right of the small yellow thing. To answer this, we need to determine the location of the medium blue triangle and the small yellow squares.

From the facts, we know that the medium blue triangle is in block C, and the small yellow squares are in block A. Since block A is to the left of block B, and block B is to the left of block C, we can conclude that block A is to the left of block C.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is to the right of the medium blue thing in B, the large blue triangle or the large black square?""

The medium blue thing in B refers to the medium blue triangle. We need to find the object that is to the right of this medium blue triangle.

From the facts, we know that the medium blue triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle and above the large black circle. This means that the large black circle is above the medium blue triangle, but not to its right.

The large blue triangle is not mentioned as being related to the medium blue triangle in terms of right or left. However, the large black square is mentioned as being near and to the right of the large blue triangle in C.

Using the logical rule ""Inter-block object relationship"", if an object is in a block and another object is in the same block, and the block has a relation with another block, then the objects have the same relation. Since the large black square is in C and the large blue triangle is in C, and C is to the right of B, we can conclude that the large black square is to the right of the large blue triangle.

We can infer that the medium red square is touching the bottom edge of block A because the triangle and medium square are touching the bottom edge of the block (fact 11), and the medium red square is one of the objects touching the bottom edge.

Now, let's draw connections between the query and facts:

* The query asks about the relation between a square touching the left edge of a block and a square touching the bottom edge of a block.
* We have identified a medium green square touching the left edge of block B (fact 17).
* We have identified a medium red square touching the bottom edge of block A (inferred from facts 11 and 14).

Using the logical rules, we can apply the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule:

* If Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2.
* In this case, the medium green square is in block B, the medium red square is in block A, and block B is to the left of block A.
* Therefore, we can conclude that the medium green square is to the left of the medium red square.

The correct answer is: left.",Below
There is a block. We called it A. It has four medium squares. Two of them are yellow and two of them are blue. one of the blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""Which square is above a yellow square? a medium blue square, a medium yellow square, both of them, or none of them?""

To answer this question, we need to find the relationship between the yellow squares and the blue squares. From the facts, we know that:

* a1 and a2 are yellow squares (facts 2 and 3).
* a3 is a blue square that is touching the bottom edge of block A (fact 6).
* a4 is a blue square that is on top of a3 (fact 7).
* a1 and a2 are on top of a3 (fact 8).

Using the logical rule ""Inter-block object relationship"", we can infer that:

* a1 and a2 are above a3.

So, the answer is: a medium blue square.

Justification:

* The query asks which square is above a yellow square.
* We found that a1 and a2 are yellow squares and are above a3, which is a blue square.
* Therefore, a medium blue square is above a yellow square.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""Which object is below a medium blue circle? the small square or the yellow triangle?""

To answer this question, we need to find the objects that are below a medium blue circle. From the facts, we know that there are two medium blue circles: one in block B and one in block C.

From fact 12, we know that one of the medium blue circles in block B is touching the top edge of the block. From fact 13, we know that the other medium blue circle in block B is touching the bottom and left edge of the block. This means that both medium blue circles in block B are not below any other object.

From fact 7, we know that there is a medium blue circle in block C. From fact 8, we know that there is a small black square in block C, which is touching the bottom edge of the block. This means that the small black square is below the medium blue circle in block C.

From fact 3, we know that there is a medium yellow triangle in block A. However, there is no fact that suggests the medium yellow triangle is below a medium blue circle.

Therefore, the answer is:

* The small black square is below a medium blue circle.

So, the correct candidate answer is: the small square.",the small square

Key information:

* The small blue circle is in block C (object(medium_blue_triangle, medium, blue, triangle, C))
* The large black square is in block B (object(large_black_square, large, black, square, B))
* The small blue circle is far below the large black square (far_below(large_black_square, small_blue_circle))

**Step 4: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks if the small blue thing (small_blue_circle) is far from the large black thing (large_black_square). The facts provide the necessary information to answer this question.

**Step 5: Answer the question**

Using the Inter-block object relationship rule, we can conclude that the small blue circle is far from the large black square, as they are in different blocks (C and B, respectively) and the large black square is far below the small blue circle.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is to the left of the black thing in C?""

The black thing in C is the black square. To find the object to its left, we need to look at the objects in C and their relations.

From fact 12, we know that the black square is in block C. From fact 14, we know that the yellow triangle is to its right and far from it. This means that the yellow triangle is not to the left of the black square.

From fact 11, we know that block B is to the right of block C. From fact 2, we know that the small blue circle is in block A, which is to the left of block B. Therefore, the small blue circle is to the left of block C, and hence to the left of the black square in C.

Conclusion: The object to the left of the black thing in C is the small blue circle.

We can represent the query as:

?X is not near the medium black thing in C, the large blue thing or the small blue thing in C.

From the facts, we can identify the medium black thing in C as the medium black square (object(medium_black_square, medium, black, square, c)). The large blue thing in C is the large blue triangle (object(large_blue_triangle, large, blue, triangle, c)). The small blue thing in C is the small blue square (object(small_blue_square, small, blue, square, c)).

From the facts, we can also identify the objects near the medium black square in C:

* The medium black square is below the large blue triangle (fact 8).
* The medium black square is touching the bottom of C (fact 9).

From these facts, we can conclude that the large blue triangle is near the medium black square in C. Therefore, the large blue thing in C is not the object that is not near the medium black thing in C.

Similarly, we can conclude that the small blue square is near the medium black square in C, as it is below the medium black square (fact 5).

However, we cannot conclude that the medium blue square is near the medium black square in C, as it is not mentioned in the facts.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* The medium yellow square is in block A (fact 7) and block C (fact 11).
* The small black triangle is in block C (fact 12).
* The large blue triangle is near and to the left of the small black triangle (fact 14).

**Step 3: Draw Connections between Query and Facts**

The query asks if the small yellow thing (triangle) in A is near and above a small blue thing. However, there is no small blue thing mentioned in the context. The only small blue object mentioned is the small blue circle, which is in block A and block B. Since the query asks about the small yellow triangle in A, we cannot directly answer the query.

**Step 4: Apply Spatial Logical Rules**

We can apply the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule to connect the objects across blocks. Since the small blue circle is in block A and block B, and block A is to the right of block B, we can infer that the small blue circle is to the right of the small yellow triangle in block B.

However, this does not provide enough information to answer the query. We need more information about the position of the small blue circle in block A relative to the small yellow triangle.

**Step 2: Analyze the given facts, highlight and explain the key information in the facts of the context that directly relate to the query**

The key information that directly relates to the query is the presence of circles in each block. Specifically, we know that:

* Block A has no circle (fact 6).
* Block B has a large yellow circle (facts 7, 9, and 10).
* Block C has a small blue circle (fact 12).

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks which block does not have a circle inside of it. Based on the facts, we can conclude that:

* Block A does not have a circle (fact 6).
* Block B has a circle (facts 7, 9, and 10).
* Block C has a circle (fact 12).

**Step 4: Answer the question**

The answer to the query is **A**, as it is the only block that does not have a circle inside of it.

**Justification**

The answer is justified by the facts, specifically fact 6, which states that there is no circle in block A. The other blocks, B and C, have circles according to facts 7, 9, 10, and 12. Therefore, block A is the correct answer.",C
"There is three blocks called A, B, C. Block A has two big blue shapes to the left of a big yellow triangle. There is also a little triangle to the left of blue objects. there is a big black triangle touching the bottom edge of block B.

8. relation(right, medium_triangle2, medium_triangle1).

Now, let's analyze the query:

""Which object is to the left of the medium shape which is near to the small circle? a little triangle or a medium triangle?""

To answer this question, we need to find the medium shape that is near to the small circle and then find the object that is to the left of it.

From fact 6, we know that the small blue circle is near to the medium circle. From fact 3, we know that the medium circle is on top of block B. Therefore, the medium shape that is near to the small circle is the medium circle.

From fact 4, we know that the little triangle is to the left of the blue oval, and the blue oval is to the left of the large blue triangle. However, we don't have any information about the position of the medium triangles with respect to the medium circle.

From fact 8, we know that the medium triangles are in block C, and block C is left to blocks A and B. Therefore, it is possible that one of the medium triangles is to the left of the medium circle.

However, we don't have enough information to determine which object is to the left of the medium shape. Therefore, the correct answer is:

""both of them""

Note that we can't say ""none of them"" because we know that one of the medium triangles is in block C, which is left to blocks A and B, and the medium circle is on top of block B.",a little triangle

From the facts, we can conclude that:

* Block A contains a small yellow triangle (fact 3).
* Block B contains a large blue triangle (fact 7).
* Block C does not contain any triangles (no mention of triangles in facts 1-10).

**Step 4: Answer the question**

Based on the facts, we can answer the query as follows:

The block that does not have a triangle inside of it is **C**.

**Justification**

The query asks which block does not contain a triangle. From the facts, we know that Block A contains a small yellow triangle, and Block B contains a large blue triangle. However, there is no mention of triangles in Block C. Therefore, Block C is the only block that does not contain a triangle, making it the correct answer.",C

Now, let's analyze the query: ""What block does not have any small objects inside of it?""

From the facts, we can see that:

* Block A has a small yellow circle and a small blue circle.
* Block B has a small blue square.
* Block C has a small yellow triangle and a small blue square.

Using the logical rules, we can conclude that:

* Block A has small objects (small yellow circle and small blue circle).
* Block B has small objects (small blue square).
* Block C has small objects (small yellow triangle and small blue square).

Therefore, the answer to the query is: None of the blocks (A, B, or C) do not have any small objects inside of it.

However, we can also answer the query by analyzing the facts and using the logical rules. We can see that all blocks have small objects inside of them. Therefore, the answer is: None of the blocks (A, B, or C) do not have any small objects inside of it.

We can represent the query as:

?Object1 \= near(Object1, medium_yellow_circle) ∧ ?Object1 \= near(Object1, medium_blue_circle) ∧ ?Object1 \= near(Object1, small_blue_triangle)

From the facts, we can identify the objects that are near the medium yellow thing in A (medium yellow circle):

* medium blue circle
* large black square

From the facts, we can identify the objects that are near the medium blue circle:

* medium yellow circle
* large black square

From the facts, we can identify the objects that are near the small blue triangle:

* medium yellow triangle
* medium blue triangle
* large black circle

Now, let's analyze the query again:

""What object is not near the medium yellow thing in A, the medium blue circle or the small blue triangle?""

We can see that the objects that are not near the medium yellow thing in A, the medium blue circle, or the small blue triangle are:

* large black square (not near medium yellow circle)
* large black circle (not near medium blue circle)
* medium black triangle (not near small blue triangle)

Query: Which block has a circle to the left of a circle which is on the left of another circle?

**Step 3: Analyze the given facts, highlight and explain the key information in the facts of the context that directly relate to the query**

Key information:

* In block A, there is a black triangle above and to the left of a black circle (facts 2-4).
* In block B, there are two yellow circles, a blue circle, and a blue square (facts 6-7).
* The blue circle is touching the left edge of B, and one of the yellow circles is to the right of the blue circle and to the left of the blue square (facts 8-11).
* The blue square is touching the right edge of B and is above the other yellow circle, which is also touching the right edge of B (facts 12-14).

**Step 4: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks about a block with a circle to the left of a circle which is on the left of another circle. We can find this scenario in block B:

* The blue circle is to the left of the yellow circle1 (fact 11).
* The yellow circle1 is to the left of the blue square (fact 11).
* The blue square is touching the right edge of B (fact 12).

17. touching(yellow_circle2, right_edge(b)).

Now, let's analyze the query: ""What relations exist between the blue object above the yellow thing and the black object above the black thing?""

The key information in the facts that directly relate to the query are:

* The blue object above the yellow thing is the blue square (object(blue_square, unknown, blue, square, b)).
* The black object above the black thing is the black triangle (object(black_triangle, unknown, black, triangle, a)).
* The blue square is above the yellow circle2 (above(blue_square, yellow_circle2)).

From the facts, we can conclude that the blue square is above the yellow circle2, and the black triangle is above the black circle. We can also conclude that the blue square is in block B, and the black triangle is in block A.

Using the spatial logical rules, we can draw connections between the query and facts:

* Since the blue square is above the yellow circle2, and the yellow circle2 is touching the right edge of B, we can apply the rule ""If Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2"" to conclude that the blue square is above the right edge of B.
* Since the black triangle is above the black circle, and the black circle is in block A, we can apply the rule ""If Object is in Block, and Block [Relation] Object, then Object [Relation] Block"" to conclude that the black triangle is above block A.

Now, let's analyze the query again:

* What relations exist between the blue object above the yellow thing and the black object above the black thing?

From the facts and logical rules, we can conclude that:

* The blue object above the yellow thing (blue square) is above the right edge of B.
* The black object above the black thing (black triangle) is above block A.

Using the spatial logical rules, we can answer the query:

* The blue object above the yellow thing is above the black object above the black thing.

The key information in the facts that directly relate to the query is:

* The medium black thing is a circle (object(medium_black_circle, medium, black, circle, a)).
* The medium yellow thing is a square (object(medium_yellow_square, medium, yellow, square, a)).
* The medium black circle is touching the left side of the medium yellow square (relation(left, medium_yellow_square, medium_black_circle)).

Using the logical rules, we can draw connections between the query and facts:

* Since the medium black circle is touching the left side of the medium yellow square, we can conclude that the medium black thing (circle) is touching the medium yellow thing (square).

Answer: Yes

Justification: The logical rule used is the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule, which states that if Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2. In this case, the medium black circle is in block A, the medium yellow square is also in block A, and the medium black circle is touching the left side of the medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium black thing (circle) is touching the medium yellow thing (square).",Yes

8. far_above(blue_triangle, small_blue_circle).
9. left(blue_triangle, black_triangle).

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is to is not touching a large blue thing?""

We need to identify the objects that are not touching a large blue thing. A large blue thing refers to a large blue triangle (object(large_blue_triangle, large, blue, triangle, b)).

From the facts, we know that the large yellow triangle (object(large_yellow_triangle, large, yellow, triangle, b)) is touching the large blue triangle. Therefore, the large yellow triangle is not an object that is not touching a large blue thing.

The small blue circle (object(small_blue_circle, small, blue, circle, a)) is near and above a small blue circle, which is not touching a large blue thing. Therefore, the small blue circle is an object that is not touching a large blue thing.

The small blue circle in block C (object(small_blue_circle, small, blue, circle, c)) is far above a blue triangle, which is to the left of a black triangle. The blue triangle is not a large blue thing, so the small blue circle in block C is also an object that is not touching a large blue thing.

The other objects mentioned in the context (medium blue circle, large blue triangle, small yellow triangle, black triangle) are either touching a large blue thing or are not relevant to the query.

Conclusion:

The correct answer is: the small blue circle.

Justification:

* The large yellow triangle is touching a large blue thing, so it's not an object that is not touching a large blue thing.
* The small blue circle in block A is near and above a small blue circle, which is not touching a large blue thing.
* The small blue circle in block C is far above a blue triangle, which is not a large blue thing.

Therefore, the small blue circle is the object that is not touching a large blue thing.",the small blue circle

Now, let's convert the question into a query:

Where is the square in block B regarding to blue square?

Query: What is the relation between the yellow square in block B and the blue square in block A?

To answer this question, we need to analyze the facts and draw connections between the query and the facts.

From fact 7, we know that the yellow square in block A is on top of the blue square. From fact 8, we know that the yellow square in block B is touching the bottom edge of block B. Since block B is not above or below block A, the yellow square in block B cannot be above or below the blue square in block A.

From fact 4, we know that block C is below block A and B. Since the yellow square in block B is not above or below the blue square in block A, it cannot be touching or near the blue square in block A.

Therefore, the answer is: far from.

Justification: The yellow square in block B is not in the same block as the blue square in block A, and it is not above or below the blue square. Therefore, it is far from the blue square.",Below

* A has a large blue triangle and a small yellow square.
* B has a medium blue circle and a small black circle.
* C has a large blue triangle and a large black circle.

Now, I will analyze the given facts and highlight the key information that directly relates to the query.

The query is asking if the small black thing in C is below a large black thing in C. From the facts, we can see that there is a small black circle in C (fact 10) and a large black triangle in C (fact 12). However, there is no fact that explicitly states the relationship between these two objects.

To answer the query, we need to apply spatial logical rules. Since there is no fact that directly relates the two objects, we can use the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule. This rule states that if Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2.

In this case, we can apply this rule to the objects in C. Since the small black circle is in C (fact 10) and the large black triangle is in C (fact 12), we can conclude that the small black circle is below the large black triangle.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Yes

* The query asks if there is a blue thing below a large yellow object.
* The facts mention several blue objects: small blue square, large blue square, and blue triangle.
* The facts also mention several large yellow objects: large yellow square.

The key connection between the query and the facts is that the query asks about the relationship between a blue thing and a large yellow object. The facts provide information about the location and properties of these objects.

Using the logical rules, I can draw connections between the query and the facts:

* The fact ""above(large_yellow_square, small_blue_circle)"" implies that the large yellow square is above the small blue circle.
* The fact ""below(large_yellow_square, blue_triangle)"" implies that the large yellow square is below the blue triangle.
* The fact ""left(blue_triangle, black_circle)"" implies that the blue triangle is to the left of the black circle.

From these connections, I can conclude that the blue triangle is below the large yellow square. Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Now, let's analyze the facts and highlight the key information that directly relates to the query:

* The query asks which block has only circles inside.
* From the facts, we know that block A has three objects: a small red circle, a green circle, and a big blue circle (facts 4-6).
* The big blue circle is touching the bottom edge of A, and the green circle is touching the top edge of A (facts 14 and 15).
* There are no other objects mentioned in block A that are not circles.

Based on the facts, we can conclude that block A is the only block that has only circles inside.

Answer: A

Justification: The query asks which block has only circles inside. From the facts, we know that block A has three objects: a small red circle, a green circle, and a big blue circle. The big blue circle is touching the bottom edge of A, and the green circle is touching the top edge of A. There are no other objects mentioned in block A that are not circles.

7. far_to_the_right(small_black_triangle, small_yellow_triangle)
8. near_and_to_the_right(small_black_triangle, medium_blue_triangle)

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is to the left of the small yellow thing, the medium yellow thing in A or the small blue thing in A? the medium yellow thing in a or the small blue thing in a?""

We can rephrase the query as:

""What object is to the left of the small yellow triangle, the medium yellow square in A or the small blue circle in A?""

From the facts, we know that the small yellow triangle is far to the right of the small black triangle (fact 7). We also know that the small black triangle is near and to the right of the medium blue triangle (fact 8).

Using the ""Inter-block object relationship"" logical rule, we can infer that the small yellow triangle is in block C, since it is far to the right of the small black triangle, which is in block C.

Now, let's examine the objects in block A:

* The medium yellow square is in block A (fact 3).
* The small blue circle is in block A (fact 2).

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" logical rule, we can infer that the medium yellow square and the small blue circle are both in block A.

The query asks about the objects to the left of the small yellow triangle, the medium yellow square in A, or the small blue circle in A. Since the small yellow triangle is in block C, it is not relevant to the query.

The medium yellow square in A is to the left of the small blue circle in A (fact 2). Therefore, the correct answer is:

* the small blue thing in A

The medium yellow thing in A is not to the left of the small yellow triangle, so it is not a correct answer.

The small blue thing in A is to the left of the medium yellow thing in A, so it is also not a correct answer.

Now, let's analyze the query:

""Which object is left of a black square?""

The query is asking about the object that is left of the black square. To answer this, we need to find the object that is left of the black square.

From the facts, we know that the black square is in block C, and there is no other object mentioned in block C. Therefore, we need to look at the objects in block B, which is to the right of block A.

In block B, there are two objects: the large yellow square and the small yellow square. The large yellow square is near and to the left of the small yellow square. This means that the large yellow square is left of the small yellow square.

However, the query is asking about the object that is left of the black square, not the small yellow square. Since the black square is in block C, and block C is to the right of block B, the black square is not left of any object in block B.

Therefore, the answer is:

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What is the relation between the red square and the blue thing Which is below the yellow square?""

The query is asking about the relation between the red square and the blue thing that is below the yellow square. We need to find the blue thing that is below the yellow square.

From fact 8, we know that the small blue circle is to the left of the yellow square. From fact 6, we know that the small blue circle is in block B. From fact 9, we know that block B is above block A.

Now, let's consider the blue thing that is below the yellow square. Since the small blue circle is in block B and block B is above block A, the small blue circle cannot be the blue thing that is below the yellow square. Therefore, the blue thing that is below the yellow square must be the big blue circle, which is in block A.

From fact 5, we know that the big blue circle is below the red square. Therefore, the relation between the red square and the blue thing (big blue circle) that is below the yellow square is below.

Now, let's analyze the query: ""What is the relation between the small circle and the big square?""

The key information in the facts that directly relate to the query is:

* The small black circle is in block C (fact 19).
* The big yellow square is in block C (fact 16).
* The big yellow square is touching the right edge of block C (not explicitly stated, but implied by the fact that it's in block C).

From these facts, we can conclude that the small black circle and the big yellow square are in the same block, C. However, we need to determine their spatial relationship.

Using the logical rule ""Inter-block object relationship"", we can infer that the small black circle is to the right of the big blue triangle (fact 19), and the big yellow square is touching the right edge of block C (implied by fact 16).

Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the small black circle is below the big yellow square, as it's to the right of the big blue triangle and the big yellow square is touching the right edge of block C.

Now, let's analyze the key information in the facts that directly relate to the query:

* The query is asking if the large black square is far below the other large black thing.
* The other large black thing is the large black circle.
* The large black circle is above the large black square.

From the facts, we can conclude that the large black circle is far above the large black square. This means that the large black square is not far below the large black circle.

The query cannot be answered directly by the given facts, so we need to apply spatial logical rules.

* We can apply the ""inverse relation"" rule to conclude that the large black square is below the large black circle.
* We can apply the ""object-block relationship"" rule to conclude that the large black square is in block A, and the large black circle is in block A.
* We can apply the ""inter-block object relationship"" rule to conclude that the large black square is not far below the large black circle, because they are in the same block.

Based on these conclusions, we can answer the query:

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is to the right of the small yellow thing?""

The small yellow thing refers to the small yellow triangle. We need to find out what object is to the right of it.

From fact 5, we know that the small yellow triangle is in block B. From fact 2, we know that block C is to the right of block B. Therefore, the small yellow triangle is in block B, and the objects in block C are to the right of it.

From fact 5, we also know that the large yellow triangle is in block B and is touching the large blue triangle. The small yellow triangle is to the left of the large blue triangle (fact 5). Therefore, the large yellow triangle is to the right of the small yellow triangle.

So, the answer is: the large yellow triangle.

Now, let's analyze the query and highlight the key information in the facts that directly relate to the query:

The query is ""Is the large black thing below a medium yellow thing?""

The key information in the facts is:

* The large black thing is in block C (object(large_black_circle, large, black, circle, c)).
* The medium yellow thing is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but we can infer that it might refer to the medium yellow circle or the medium yellow triangle.
* The medium yellow circle is in block C (object(medium_yellow_circle, medium, yellow, circle, c)).
* The medium yellow triangle is in block B (object(medium_yellow_triangle, medium, yellow, triangle, b)).

Now, let's draw connections between the query and facts:

* The large black thing is in block C, and block C is to the right of block B (left(b, c)).
* The medium yellow triangle is in block B, and block B is to the left of block C (left(a, b)).
* Since the large black thing is in block C and the medium yellow triangle is in block B, the large black thing cannot be below the medium yellow triangle.

However, the query does not specify which medium yellow thing it refers to. It could be the medium yellow circle or the medium yellow triangle. Since the large black thing is in block C and the medium yellow circle is also in block C, it is possible that the large black thing is below the medium yellow circle.

To answer the query, we need to apply the spatial logical rules:

* % Inter-block object relationship: If Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2.
* % Object-block relationship: If Object is in Block, and Block [Relation] Object, then Object [Relation] Block.

Using these rules, we can conclude that the large black thing is below the medium yellow circle.

Now, I will analyze the given facts and highlight the key information that directly relates to the query.

The query is ""Is the white thing above the green thing?""

From the facts, we can see that the white triangle is at the bottom of block B, and the green circle is in block A. There is no direct relation between the white triangle and the green circle.

However, we can apply the ""Inter-block object relationship"" logical rule to connect the blocks and objects. Since block B is below block A, we can infer that the white triangle (in block B) is below the green circle (in block A).

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Now, let's analyze the query: ""What is the relation between the big yellow circle and the yellow circle above a blue circle?""

From the facts, we can identify the following key information:

* The big yellow circle is in block A (object(big_yellow_circle, large, yellow, circle, a)).
* There is a yellow circle above a blue circle in block C (object(big_blue_triangle, large, blue, triangle, c) and object(big_yellow_square, large, yellow, square, c)).
* The yellow circle above a blue circle is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that it is the big yellow square (object(big_yellow_square, large, yellow, square, c)).

To answer the query, we need to find the relation between the big yellow circle in block A and the big yellow square in block C. Since block A is below blocks B and C, we can apply the ""below"" relation to connect the blocks:

* below(a, b).
* below(a, c)

Using the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule, we can infer that the big yellow circle in block A is below the big yellow square in block C:

* big_yellow_circle [below] big_yellow_square

However, this is not the correct answer, as the query asks about the relation between the big yellow circle and the yellow circle above a blue circle. We need to find the relation between the big yellow circle and the big yellow square.

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" rule, we can infer that the big yellow square is in block C:

* big_yellow_square [in] c

Since block C is to the right of block B, we can apply the ""right_of"" relation to connect the blocks:

* right_of(block_b, block_c)

Using the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule, we can infer that the big yellow square in block C is to the right of the big blue triangle in block C:

* big_yellow_square [right_of] big_blue_triangle

Now, we can answer the query. The big yellow circle is below the big blue triangle, and the big yellow square is to the right of the big blue triangle.

From the context, we can identify the following key information:

* There are no medium blue triangles mentioned in the context.
* There are two big black circles (black_circle1 and black_circle2) mentioned in the context.

Since there are no medium blue triangles mentioned, we cannot determine a direct relation between them and the big black circles. However, we can try to find a connection between the two using spatial logical rules.

Using the ""Inter-block object relationship"" rule, we can infer that since block B contains the big black circles, and block B is above block A, the big black circles are above block A.

Using the ""Object-block relationship"" rule, we can infer that since the blue triangle is in block A, and block A is below block C, the blue triangle is below block C.

Since there is no direct relation mentioned between the medium blue triangles and the big black circles, we cannot answer the query directly. However, we can apply the ""Symmetric relations"" rule to infer that since the big black circles are above block A, the blue triangle (which is in block A) is also above the big black circles.

Therefore, the relation between all medium blue triangles and all big black circles is ""above"".

Now, let's analyze the query:

""What object is near and below the small black thing in B, the small blue square or the large yellow circle?""

The key information in the facts that directly relate to the query is:

* The small black thing in B is the small black circle (object(small_black_circle, small, black, circle, b)).
* The small black circle is above the large yellow circle (above(small_black_circle, large_yellow_circle)).
* The large yellow circle is in block B (object(large_yellow_circle, large, yellow, circle, b)).

From the facts, we can conclude that the large yellow circle is near and above the small black circle in block B. Therefore, the object that is near and below the small black thing in B is the large yellow circle.

Answer: The large yellow circle.

Justification: The query asks about the object that is near and below the small black thing in B. The small black thing is the small black circle, which is above the large yellow circle. Therefore, the large yellow circle is the object that is near and below the small black thing in B.",the small blue square
There are two blocks A and B. Block A has two medium yellow circle and a medium yellow triangle. The medium circle number one is to the right of the yellow triangle which is to the right of the medium circle number two. This block also has a medium black triangle touching the bottom edge of it. Block B is to the right of the block A. It has two medium yellow circle and a medium black triangle. It also has a big blue square above the medium yellow circle number one.

The big square is to the right of the triangle.,Where is the circle number one in block B regarding to the triangle under a medium yellow circle?,FR,"left, right, above, below, near to, far from, touching, DK",right,,"Let's break down the context into facts:

5. relation(medium_black_triangle, left, medium_yellow_circle_1). relation(medium_yellow_circle_1, right, medium_yellow_circle_2). relation(big_blue_square, right, medium_black_triangle).

Now, let's analyze the query:

""Where is the circle number one in block B regarding to the triangle under a medium yellow circle?""

We can rephrase the query as:

""What is the relation between the circle number one in block B and the triangle under a medium yellow circle in block B?""

From the facts, we know that the medium yellow circle number one is located in block B (fact 3). We also know that the medium black triangle is located in block B (fact 3) and is touching the bottom edge of block A (fact 4). However, we don't have any direct information about the triangle under a medium yellow circle in block B.

To answer the query, we can apply the ""Inter-block object relationship"" logical rule:

""If Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, then Object1 [Relation] Object2.""

In this case, we can apply this rule to the medium yellow circle number one in block B and the triangle under a medium yellow circle in block B. Since block A is to the left of block B (fact 1), we can infer that the triangle under a medium yellow circle in block B is to the right of the medium yellow circle number one in block B.

Therefore, the answer is:

Now, let's analyze the query: ""What block has all triangles inside of it?""

From the facts, we can identify the blocks and the triangles inside each block:

* Block A: medium_yellow_triangle, large_yellow_triangle
* Block B: medium_yellow_triangle, small_blue_triangle
* Block C: no triangles

The query asks for the block that has all triangles inside of it. Since Block A has two triangles, and Block B has three triangles (including the medium_yellow_triangle), Block A and Block B both have triangles inside of them. However, Block C does not have any triangles.

Using the logical rule ""Object-block relationship"", we can conclude that the block with all triangles inside of it is Block A.

5. relation(red_circle, yellow_circle). relation(pink_circle, green_circle). relation(yellow_circle, green_circle).
6. relation(blue_rectangle, purple_rectangle).
7. relation(b, c).

Now, let's analyze the key information in the facts that directly relate to the query:

* The blue rectangle is touching the top and left of B.
* The purple rectangle is near and to the right of the blue rectangle, and also touching the top of B.
* The blue rectangle is in block B, and the purple rectangle is also in block B.

From these facts, we can conclude that the blue rectangle and the purple rectangle are in the same block, B. Since the purple rectangle is near and to the right of the blue rectangle, it is to the right of the blue rectangle.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Yes, the blue object (rectangle) is to the left of the purple thing (rectangle).

The key information that directly relates to the query is:

* block A has a small black circle (fact 5) and a big blue circle (fact 12) with the small black circle above it (fact 10).
* block B has a big black circle (fact 14) that is touching the top edge of the block (fact 15).

**Step 3: Draw connections between the query and facts**

The query asks which block has all circles below a big yellow triangle. From the facts, we can see that:

* block A has a small black circle (fact 5) and a big blue circle (fact 12) with the small black circle above it (fact 10).
* block B has a big black circle (fact 14) that is touching the top edge of the block (fact 15).

Since the query asks for all circles below a big yellow triangle, we can conclude that:

* block B has a big black circle (fact 14) that is touching the top edge of the block (fact 15), which means it is not below a big yellow triangle.
* block A has a small black circle (fact 5) and a big blue circle (fact 12) with the small black circle above it (fact 10), which means the big blue circle is below a big yellow triangle (since there is no big yellow triangle mentioned in the facts).

**Step 4: Answer the question**

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that:
