* **Relative Positions:** The prompt uses terms like ""at,"" ""above,"" ""below,"" ""to the left,"" ""to the right,"" and ""over there"" to describe the relationships between agents (Z, G, A, D, T, V) and objects (A, V).

* **Visualizing:** It helps to imagine a simple diagram.  You can represent agents as dots and objects as shapes.

**The Problem**

The prompt doesn't give us enough information to determine the exact relationship between G and D.  

**Why?**

* **Limited Information:** We know:
    * Z is at T's 6 o'clock.
    * G and A are with Z.
    * A is below G.
    * D is ""over there"" and Z is to its right.
    * V is to the bottom left of T.
    * A and V are ""over there"" (same place as D?).
    * A is lower and slightly to the left of V.

* **Ambiguity:**  The phrase ""over there"" is used multiple times, making it unclear if D, A, and V are in the same general location.

* H is directly south-east of P, so P is north-west of H.
* P is placed in the left direction of G, so G is to the right of P.
* Since H is south-east of P, and P is to the left of G, H is also to the left of G.
