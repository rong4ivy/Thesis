the lamp is right of the green thing."

no","yes.

however, if we assume that ""brown thing"" refers to either the iron bed (which is light brown) and pillows or just one of them being brown, while ""orange thing"" could refer to any orange-colored object within this context such as a decoration on the wall: 

question: is there an orange item in the room? yes.
context provided does not specify if all walls are only white and orange or just one of them is painted with these colors, but it's safe to assume that at least some part of the room has been described as having orange coloration since you asked about ""orange thing"". 

question: is there a brown item in the room? yes.
the bed (made from iron and light brown pillows) is clearly mentioned, so we can confirm its presence within this context. the towels are also specified as white but could potentially be of any color including brown; however, without explicit information about their colors, i cannot definitively answer that they're brown based on the provided description alone.

question: is there a bed in the room? yes. 
the double iron bed is explicitly mentioned within this context and thus we can confirm its presence.

based on these answers to individual questions about color-coded items, i cannot accurately answer whether ""the brown thing"" (presumably referring to one of the previously identified brown objects) is below ""the orange thing"". this question requires specific spatial information which has not been provided in this context and thus would be considered unanswerable based on common sense reasoning tasks without additional details.
