Fact_Rule_prompt = """
   Your are tasked with analyzing with a given context to answer a specific spatial question. Please follow the following instructions:
 1. identify ALL FACTS in EVERY SETENCE of context, and represent every sentence as facts, convert the question into query.
    Use only three predicates with the exact number of arguments, "block/1, relation/2, and object/5" to represent the facts.
        - block(name), eg. block(a). block(a;b;c).
        - object(distinct_name,block_located), eg. object(large_blue_triangle,  a). object(blue_oval,, b).
        - relation(object1, object2), eg. left(large_blue_triangle, blue_oval), above(a, b).
2. Analyze the given facts, highlight and explain the key information in the facts of the context that directly relate to the query. 
3. Draw connections between the query and facts. If the query can be solved by the given facts, answer the question directly. 
4. If query can not be solved by the facts, apply relevant spatiail logical rules to infer new spatial relation and choose the best answer from the choices. 
   You may find the following logical rules is helpful for you to answer the questions.
   % Inverse Relations: If A [Relation1] B, then B [Relation2] A.
  - Examples: 
     * front <-> behind * in <-> contain * cover <-> covered_by * above <-> below * left_of <-> right_of * near <-> far
     * on <-> under * inside <-> outside * up <-> down * far <-> close
  % Symmetric Relations: If A [Relation] B, then B [Relation] A.
   - Examples: near, far, touching, adjacent, next_to, disconnected, alongside
  % Transitive Relations: If A [Relation] B and B [Relation] C, then A [Relation] C.
   - Examples: above, below, left, right, contain, in, on, inside
  % Inter-block Object Relationships: If Object1 is in Block1, Object2 is in Block2, and Block1 [Relation] Block2, 
     then Object1 [Relation] Object2.
5.	Verify:  Cross-check your answer and explanation against the original context, referencing facts and the logical rules. 
6.	Output your response in the following JSON format.
{ "facts": "your fact representation ",
  "answer": "Your final answer to the question",
  "reasoning": "A brief explanation of your reasoning, referencing the logical rules",}
Critical: Adhere strictly to the output json format. Do not include any additional explanation or text outside of the specified sections.
