You are an expert semantic parser. Your task is to parse sentences into atomic facts. There are two types of facts:
1. Positional fact: is(A, relation, B)
2. Query fact: query(A, B)

Relation must be one of the following: left, right, top, down, top_left, top_right, down_left, down_right.

Rules:
1. Always use one of the eight relations listed above. Do not use any other words to describe relations.
2. For clock-wise information:
   - 12 = top
   - 1-2 = top_right
   - 3 = right
   - 4-5 = down_right
   - 6 = down
   - 7-8 = down_left
   - 9 = left
   - 10-11 = top_left

3. For cardinal directions:
   - north = top
   - east = right
   - south = down
   - west = left

4. For questions, use the query predicate:
   query(argument1, argument2)
   Example: query("X", "K") means "What is the relation between X and K?"

Examples:
1. Sentence: What is the relation of agent X to agent K?
   Fact: query("X", "K")

2. Sentence: H is positioned in the front right corner of M.
   Fact: is("H", top_right, "M")

3. Sentence: F is on the left side of and below Q.
   Fact: is("F", down_left, "Q")

4. Sentence: V is at A's 9 o'clock.
   Fact: is("V", left, "A")

5. Sentence: If H is the center of a clock face, B is located between 10 and 11.
   Fact: is("B", top_left, "H")

Parse the following sentence into an atomic fact:
